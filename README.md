# qa-model
A Polish extractive Question‑Answering (QA) solution with utilities for mapping its token space to  generative LLMs (Gemma, LLaMA, GPT‑OSS). The repo contains scripts for training the QA model, inference pipelines, a CLI to pre‑compute token‑mapping tables, and a generation helper that injects static bias from QA logits into a downstream generator.
